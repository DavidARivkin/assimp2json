assimp2json - command line JSON exporter for Open Asset Import Library

Introduction
============

Assimp2Json is a command line tool designed to expose the import capabilities of the Open Asset Import Library ("Assimp", http://assimp.sourceforge.net) to JavaScript developers. The tool takes a single 3d model as input file, imports it using Assimp and converts the library's in-memory data structure to a plain JSON-representation.

Assimp2Json is platform-independent, its only dependency is Assimp itself.

JSON Output Format
==================

The output format is a one-by-one translation of Assimp's C datastructure (http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/structai_scene.html), with a few changes to make the resulting JSON look more natural. All fields are lower-case and the prefixed (m, pc, ..) are omitted. Array length fields are, of course, not written because this information is implicitly contained in the array fields themselves. Empty array fields are not written, i.e. a node without children doesn't have an empty `children:[]` field.

The /sample folder contains some sample JSON dumps.

Build
=====

The build system for assimp2json is CMake, have a look at the INSTALL file for further instructions (but don't be disappointed if you find only few).

Usage
=====

$ assimp2json [flags] input_file [output_file] 
(omit the output argument to get the data on stdout)

Invoke `assimp2json` with no arguments for detailed information.
